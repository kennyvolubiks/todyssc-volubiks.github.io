This workspace previously only contained a README. I scaffolded a minimal Vite + React demo that
shows skeleton product cards and then renders shop content.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the dev URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- `src/api.js` contains a demo `fetchProducts()` that returns sample products after a short delay.
- Replace `fetchProducts()` with your real API call to integrate with an existing backend.
